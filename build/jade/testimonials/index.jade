							p When I decided to hire Ghis I saw a very talented driven creative individual that wanted to make a massive difference in my organisation. I was not wrong about this, Ghis not only proven himself as one of the most technically gifted members of our team, but he also showed that tremendous humility and desire to grow professionally and as a Human Being.

							p Working with Ghis has been great since Day 1 due to his devotion to creating great scalable products. While working with him, he has introduced the SASS framework into our systems and brought in new tools to expedite the design process. Ghis has also brought along with him modern day design principles and best practices and consistently researches methods to improve himself and the product. I'm excited to see all the products that we can create together.

							p Ghis and I were the first few pioneers of the product that we are working on together and he has shown to me that he is able to handle difficult situations while persistently staying positive, above, and beyond, maintaining integrity in the work that he delivers. He wouldn't compromise the quality of designs that he does and takes the nitty gritty details very seriously, a perfectionalist I would say. I know I can count on him when it comes to work and even as a friend!

							p Ghis, to me, is the benchmark that every designer should aspire to be. He's skillful, confident in his abilities, and perhaps his most admirable quality - he's always willing to learn. If I had a problem I trusted him, if I had a question I went to him. A perfect example of an all-rounder and a great asset to any team.
